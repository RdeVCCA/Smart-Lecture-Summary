# Economic Growth Lecture Part 3

Welcome back to the last part of our economic growth lecture. 

## Consequences of High Growth

Last time, we began discussing the consequences of high growth, particularly the costs and benefits. It's essential not just to consider these in terms of positives and negatives but also their impacts on different aspects of the economy. *The impacts of growth can be viewed from the perspective of various economic agents like consumers, firms, and governments*. These impacts can be on micro and macro goals alike. 

## Benefits and Costs of High Growth

Moving forward, we'll delve deeper into the different benefits and costs of high actual growth. 

### High Standard of Living (SOL)

One key benefit of high growth is a higher SOL. This stems from increased output, which necessitates the demand for labor and consequently leads to higher wages. There is also an increase in derived demand for labour. This improved purchasing power enables workers to consume more goods and services, enhancing their material SOL. 

The government, at the same tax rates, can collect more tax revenues from higher incomes, thereby benefiting public infrastructure and services, such as hospitals that directly increase citizens’ life expectancy. The collected tax revenues can also be redirected to support lower-income individuals through transfers like GST vouchers, thereby reducing income inequality and potentially minimizing social unrest. *Both these facets contribute to increased quality of life and, therefore, a higher, non-material SOL*.

### Higher Income and Consumption  

Another notable benefit of high actual growth is the increased income and consumption. From an optimistic economic standpoint, high growth signals a thriving economy, which in turn boosts consumer and firm confidence. This positive outlook may lead to consumers and firms expecting a boost in future income and spending more, respectively. 

This higher consumption (C) and investment (I) contribute to a rise in aggregate demand, leading to an increased national income via the multiplier effect. Hence, *actual growth leads to a rise in income and consumption levels*.HERE IS THE BREAKIn summarising the lecture, the speaker emphasises the benefits of high economic growth which include an increase in employment and the opportunity for governments to reduce debt and accumulate reserves. 

The lecturer explains that hiring more factor inputs, including labour, is necessary to produce more goods and services, leading to increased employment rates. High growth reduces government debt and assists in building reserves by generating higher tax revenues. The government can be more prudent by reducing expenditure on items such as unemployment benefits due to the rise in employment, which could lead to a healthier budget position.

The lecturer also mentioned the concept of 'accumulating reserves', showing its importance in the economic context by discussing the challenges governments face during crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Without sufficient reserves, any attempt at expansionary policies to manage adverse impact might result in greater budget deficits or substantial debt. The speaker cites Singapore as an example of a government which stresses financial prudence.HERE IS THE BREAK
