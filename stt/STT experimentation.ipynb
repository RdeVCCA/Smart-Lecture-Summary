    "2. recognize_google(): Google Web Speech AP\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "3. recognize_google_cloud(): Google Cloud Speech - requires installation of the google-cloud-speech package (I checked, need pay)\n",
    "<br><br>\n",

    "<br><br>\n",

    "## Supported File Types\n",
    "1. WAV: must be in PCM/LPCM format\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "2. AIFF\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "3. AIFF-C\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "4. FLAC: must be native FLAC format; OGG-FLAC is not supported\n",

    "5. If you are working on x-86 based Linux, macOS or Windows, you should be able to work with FLAC files without a problem. On other platforms, you will need to install a FLAC encoder and ensure you have access to the flac command line tool. "
