# Economic Growth Lecture Summary

## The Impacts of High Actual Growth
During the last lecture, we delved into the implications of high actual growth. Understanding the impact of growth requires multiple perspectives, considering both positives and negatives. It's crucial to examine the effect on the economy and various economic agents— consumers, firms, government. These entities' perspectives largely shape the micro and macro level goals.

## Benefits of High Actual Growth
One significant advantage of high actual growth is an increased Standard of Living (SOL). More output and production lead to a rise in labor demand. As a result, there's an increase in wages, granting workers more purchasing power to consume goods and services, thereby improving their material SOL. 

A significant point to note is that with the increase in income, the government accrues more tax revenue at the same tax rates. This revenue can be redirected into spending on infrastructure (for instance, more hospitals), improving citizens' life expectancy and their non-material SOL. Besides, the government can redistribute wealth to lower income families through transfer programs like GST vouchers, thus reducing income inequality and potential social unrest.

The second critical benefit is a surge in income and consumption due to the booming economy. High actual growth will boost consumers' and firms' confidence in the economy. Consumers may anticipate a rise in their future income and increase spending. In contrast, firms might foresee an increased demand for their output, leading to more investment. Both these factors would lead to an increase in aggregate demand, resulting in national income growth via the multiplier effect, all culminating in higher actual growth. 

This summary emphasized that the results of high actual growth are complex, providing multiple benefits across various sectors. Nevertheless, these outcomes are interconnected and shape the economic landscape.

Firstly, it explores how high growth invariably leads to an increase in employment. Owing to the need for more goods and services, more factor inputs, including labour, must be utilized. Therefore, a high-growth economy requires a greater workforce, reducing unemployment rates. 

Secondly, the lecture argues that high growth helps reduce debt and allows the government to accumulate reserves. This argument establishes the connection between high growth and increased tax revenue. When there is high economic growth, employment rates go up resulting in diversity and abundance of tax contributions, which in turn swells government revenue. This fiscal comfort enables the government to limit its spending, thereby reducing existing debt levels. For instance, when employment is high, the government can scale back on spending money on unemployment benefits. Such prudence can help governments enhance their budget outcomes. 

Lastly, the lecture emphasizes the importance of accumulating reserves. This aspect is crucial, particularly in the face of economic crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Without substantial reserves, the government would have found it challenging to implement expansionary policies to mitigate the impacts of the crisis, without running the risk of creating budget deficits or accumulating significant debt. The lecture concludes by appreciating Singapore's government for their continual financial prudence.HERE IS THE BREAK
