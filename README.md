# SmartLectureSummary
This project utilises ChatGPT API as well as speech-to-text translation to provide a report that summarises the content of a lecture video. The user uploads a lecture video through a webpage, which will be sent to the backend. The backend will extract the speech from the video, and generate a summarised report for the user.
